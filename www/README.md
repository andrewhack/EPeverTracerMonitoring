Make Grafana Dashboard visible to public
----------------------------------------

Exporting a Grafana dashboard is a bit pain, especially if you want to refresh the data. The easiest way is direct link to an image of specific panel.

You could do that from Grafana Dashboard->Panel->Share->Direct image rendered image

**Requirements**
Grafana Image Renderer plugin - this plugin has a lot of system dependencies. Switch on the Grafana debuging and check the log in order to resolve this
